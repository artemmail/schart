vant committees; private sector representatives; former government officials; experts in the think
tank, academic, and federally funded research and development center communities; and foreign
allies. We found near-unanimous recognition of the significant challenges to U.S. national secu-
rity and broad agreement on the need for substantial and wide-ranging change. Our meetings
reinforced that people across and outside government are talented and dedicated to U.S. national
security but are impeded by systems that are outdated, bureaucratic, or too political to move with
the urgency required. Our recommendations address these systems, not the dedicated individu-
als within them.

national security experience, came to the task with fresh eyes. We all agree that past warnings,
however clear, have not succeeded in addressing our security shortfalls. Consequently, while
some of our conclusions and recommendations are similar to those of past reports, we have also
included recommendations to address the entire U.S. national security establishment.

Summary
The threats the United States faces are the most serious and most challenging the nation has
encountered since 1945 and include the potential for near-term major war. The United States
last fought a global conflict during World War II, which ended nearly 80 years ago. The nation
was last prepared for such a fight during the Cold War, which ended 35 years ago. It is not pre-
pared today.
National Defense Strategy (NDS) recognizes these nations as the top threats to the United
States and declares China to be the “pacing challenge,” based on the strength of its military and
economy and its intent to exert dominance regionally and globally.1
largely negated the U.S. military advantage in the Western Pacific through two decades of
focused military investment. Without significant change by the United States, the balance of
power will continue to shift in China’s favor. China’s overall annual spending on defense is esti-
mated at as much as $711 billion,2 and the Chinese government in March 2024 announced an
increase in annual defense spending of 7.2 percent.3

Security Strategy notes, “The PRC [People’s Republic of China] is the only competitor with both the intent to
reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power
to do it” (White House, National Security Strategy, p. 23). The NDS refers to Russia as an “acute” threat. We
believe this term inappropriately suggests a limited duration and prefer to label Russia a “chronic threat.”

expand power worldwide and coerce its neighbors. The United States needs a similarly integrated
approach to match, deter, and overcome theirs, which we describe as all elements of national
power. The NDS and the 2022 National Security Strategy promote the concept of “integrated
deterrence,” but neither one presents a plan for implementing this approach, and there are few
indications that the U.S. government is consistently integrating tools of national security power.
An effective approach to an all elements of national power strategy also relies on a coordinated
effort to bring together diplomacy, economic investment, cybersecurity, trade, education, indus-
trial capacity, technical innovation, civic engagement, and international cooperation.
the United States has successfully bolstered bilateral and multilateral alliances in the Pacific,
strengthened the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and created new arrangements,
such as AUKUS. The United States cannot compete with China, Russia, and their partners
alone—and certainly cannot win a war that way. Given the growing alignment of authoritarian
states, the United States must continue to invest in strengthening its allies and integrating its
military (and economic, diplomatic, and industrial) efforts with theirs. Alliances are not a pana-
cea, but the U.S. force structure should account for the forces and commitments from U.S. allies.
(R&D) and procurement systems, reliance on decades-old military hardware, and culture of risk
avoidance reflect an era of uncontested military dominance.8 Such methods are not suited to
today’s strategic environment. There are recent examples that demonstrate that DoD can move
quickly, break with tradition, and engage industry, including the rapid stand-up of the Space
Force, the Defense Innovation Unit, the Office of Strategic Capital, and the Replicator Initia-
tive, but these examples remain the exception rather than the rule. The larger elements of DoD

maybe for the first time, exercising together in relation to Taiwan and recognizing that this is a place where

incorporating new technology at scale; field more and higher-capability platforms, software,
and munitions; and deploy innovative operational concepts to employ them together better. The
war in Ukraine has demonstrated the need to prepare for new forms of conflict and to integrate
technology and new capabilities rapidly with older systems. Such technologies include swarms
of attritable systems, artificial intelligence–enabled capabilities, hypersonics and electronic war-
fare, fully integrated cyber and space capabilities, and vigorous competition in the information
domain. Programs that are not needed for future combat should be divested to invest in others.
equipment, technology, and munitions needs of the United States and its allies and partners.
A protracted conflict, especially in multiple theaters, would require much greater capacity to
produce, maintain, and replenish weapons and munitions. Addressing the shortfall will require
increased investment, additional manufacturing and development capacity, joint and coproduc-
tion with allies, and additional flexibility in acquisition systems. It requires partnership with
an industrial base that includes not just large, traditional defense manufacturers but also new
entrants and a wide array of companies involved in sub-tier production, cybersecurity, and
enabling services. The United States should coordinate and partner with its allies in mutually
beneficial ways to increase industrial capacity, especially since the U.S. industrial base is unable
to produce everything needed.

now in its third iteration, was intended to position the Joint Force for modern warfare against
peer competitors. The JWC deserves credit for attempting to break down service stovepipes, but

lenges on U.S. adversaries, and increasingly integrate U.S. allies.

could also hold at risk U.S. space assets, which underpin much of our daily lives and are essential

blockade of Taiwan has been estimated to cost $5 trillion, or 5 percent of global gross domestic

larger Joint and Total Force. Although the DoD workforce and all-volunteer force provide an
unmatched U.S. advantage, today’s is the smallest force in generations. It is stressed to maintain

Redoubled recruiting efforts, new incentives for service, and more flexible personnel systems
are needed to offset a lack of propensity for and interest in military service among the eligible
population. Military retention remains high, demonstrating that personnel in service largely
choose to remain in uniform. The nation must also consider the possibility that future conflict
could overwhelm the capacity of the active-duty force and should plan now to better prepare the
reserve components and, potentially, a broader mobilization.14 More broadly, we support calls
for increased levels of public and civil service to help provide a renewed sense of engagement and

terms of the magnitude of the threat, risks of strategic instability and escalation, and need for
U.S. global presence. It does not reflect many significant differences between that period and
today. Among these are advances in technology that fundamentally change the character of war
and the shift from the government to the private sector as drivers of investment, R&D, and pro-

shared security missions that are missing today. Defense spending in the Cold War relied on

world has grown more dangerous since that recommendation was made (Figure S.2).17

increasing the FY 2022 and FY 2023 base budgets brought spending above the 3 percent benchmark in total,
but budget projections are flat. Funding for allies, munitions, and submarines in the April 2024 supplemental
appropriations law is also significant.

many years of failure to recognize the changing threats and to transform the U.S. national secu-
rity structure and has been exacerbated by the 2011 Budget Control Act, repeated continuing
resolutions, and inflexible government systems. The United States is still failing to act with the
urgency required, across administrations and without regard to governing party.
these recommendations to boost all elements of national power will require sustained presiden-
tial leadership and a fundamental change in mindset at the Pentagon, at the National Security
Council and across executive branch departments and agencies, in Congress, and among the
American public writ large.

Introduction
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) in
October 2022 after completing a classified version in March 2022.1
Strategy (NSS) call the “decisive decade,”2 is largely a continuation of the priorities, approach, and
force structure described by the 2018 NDS. Both strategies emphasize planning and resources for
great power competition, specifically naming China and then Russia as the lead competitors.3
They both call for a force-sizing construct of essentially waging one major theater war while
deterring opportunistic aggression elsewhere. Both cite growing threats to U.S. interests and
observe that the U.S. military no longer enjoys dominant superiority over potential adversaries.
long text box in the 2022 NSS. The NSS describes how integration should be pursued through-
out the U.S. government, with allies and partners, and within DoD and the Joint Force.4 The
NDS argues that such a comprehensive effort is needed to counter the “holistic strategies” that
China and others employ to achieve their objectives. Both the NDS and the 2022 NSS lack a
plan for implementing this integration, and there are few indications that it is being consistently
pursued. The Commission believes an integrated, coordinated strategy is necessary and offers
concrete recommendations to improve the approach.

same time, which we find to be helpful to coordinate planning. We note, however, that the unclassified version
of the NDS was released in late October 2022, nearly halfway through the administration’s term. While the
delay was largely outside DoD’s control, we urge DoD and future administrations to release the unclassified
NDS in a more timely fashion in the future to enhance implementation.

United States are at greater risk than at any time in decades. America’s military superiority—the
hard-power backbone of its global influence and national security—has eroded to a dangerous
degree.”9 In our review, we find that the situation has deteriorated since the 2018 Commission’s
report and that many of the previous recommendations were not adopted. The strategic environ-
ment has grown substantially more challenging—including since the 2022 NDS was written—
and the United States has not kept pace with a worsening situation. We recommend measures to
close the gap while recognizing that the world has changed dramatically in recent years and that
new approaches are needed to more effectively safeguard America’s interests.

ing, and dedicated to the defense of the United States. We found near-unanimous appreciation
of the severity of the challenges our nation faces and the need for new approaches and additional
resources. Where organizations have the leadership and operational environment to innovate,
they are doing incredible work. In Ukraine, where the threat is existential, we see innovation in
practices, technology, and concepts at a speed largely foreign to the U.S. government. Govern-
ment culture, structures, and regulations generally were created during peacetime with no major
threat to U.S. security or way of life. That world is gone, but the system remains too ossified and
slow to adapt and execute the systemic change that is needed.

Strategic Environment
The strategic environment in summer 2024 presents more, and vastly more serious, challenges
to U.S. security interests than since the end of the Cold War, if not the height of World War II.
Many of the threats are intertwined and compounding, making them more difficult to over-
come. The NDS prioritizes challenges and threats posed by China, then Russia, and then from
North Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations. It also highlights the threat to the U.S.
homeland and lists transboundary challenges.
that the magnitude of the threats the United States faces is understated and significantly worse
than when the NDS was issued, especially when viewed globally and as compounding. Since the
release of the NDS, we have witnessed but not fully accounted for the strategic impact of the
“no-limits” partnership between Russia and China and their partnership with Iran and North
Korea, the outbreak of war in the Middle East, and the scope and duration of the war in Europe.
China: The Pacing and Global Threat
The NDS names China as the “pacing challenge” and invokes the National Security Strategy
finding that China is “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international
order, and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance
that objective.”1 China has strategically and systematically used the coordinated elements of
national power to build an economic, diplomatic, industrial, and military strength to assert
dominance in East Asia and project influence globally.
dable military threat. We agree with the 2022 NDS in making China the top priority for U.S.
planning and investment. China is in fact outpacing U.S. defense production and growth in
force size and, increasingly, in force capability and is almost certain to continue to do so. China

boundaries with incursions into Taiwan’s airspace and territorial waters, violating international
law in the South China Sea, and seeking to normalize unlawful behavior and establishing advan-
tageous conditions for future coercion or conflict.3
but we agree with former U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) Commander Adm.
John Aquilino, who testified in March 2024 that “[o]n a scale not seen since WWII [World
War II], the PLA’s [People’s Liberation Army’s] buildup is occurring across land, sea, air, space,
cyber, and information domains” and that “[a]ll indications point to the PLA meeting President
Xi Jinping’s directive to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.”4
aviation force in its region (which is “rapidly catching up to Western air forces”), and the larg-
est Army in the world, even after it was reduced to improve professionalization and mobility.5
Equally important to its size advantages, China’s military has modernized across the board,
especially in areas that are critical to a conflict in the Western Pacific. It has built peer- or
near-peer-level capabilities in space and cyberspace, which it would likely use to try to deter
and prevent the United States from engaging in a conflict by disrupting U.S. critical infrastruc-
ture, including computer networks, satellites, and other enabling functions.6 China is seeking
to remove what remaining advantages the United States has, including undersea capability and
information dominance and by significantly increasing the size of its strategic forces.

Continue.” Although the actual amount of Chinese defense spending is unknown, a January 2024 assessment
estimates that the comparative buying power of China’s total defense budget in 2022 was $711 billion (Eaglen,
“America’s Incredible Shrinking Navy”). This estimate was reinforced by Adm. Samuel Paparo, Commander
of INDOPACOM: “According to Paparo, China’s military budget is likely three times what Beijing publicly
claims, which would put it at about $700 billion annually” (Rogin, “The U.S. Military Plans a ‘Hellscape’
to Deter China from Attacking Taiwan”). Other estimates of China’s defense spending are lower; see Fravel,
Gilboy, and Heginbotham, “Estimating China’s Defense Spending.”

conflict against China. Although war against China, over Taiwan or otherwise, is not inevitable,
the United States should take seriously Xi Jinping’s call for the PLA to be prepared to invade
Taiwan by 2027 by being prepared to deter Chinese aggression. Deterring Chinese aggression
against Taiwan is critical for U.S. national security interests. Beyond the military and diplomatic
implications, an invasion would have massive economic consequences for the U.S. and global
economies because of the contraction in trade and the impact on supply chains. The timing
means that the United States must be ready to fight largely with the forces it has now or that
can be brought to bear quickly, recognizing that such deployments would likely be undertaken
when China was contesting U.S. logistics. DoD must continue to position forces, smartly build
combat credibility, and collaborate closely with allies immediately to deter China from taking
such coercive actions at the same time that the United States develops the capability and forces
to maintain that deterrence in the longer term.
integrated global initiatives to increase influence, economic and military ties, and the ability to
project force. In so doing, China blurs the distinctions between kinetic and non-kinetic conflict
and excels in using economic policy for national security ends. This effort includes the Belt and
Road Initiative, investment and ownership of seaports,7 an overseas military base in Djibouti
and efforts to expand elsewhere, and significant control over much of the world’s existing supply
of critical minerals.8 China frequently provides aid and investment (often with crippling financ-
ing) to strategically located countries much faster and with less rigorous review than comparable
U.S. aid programs. These blended economic and military efforts will make it more difficult for
the United States to fight and win a conflict because of their impact on potential allies and part-
ners. The U.S. military retains a significant advantage over the PLA around the world, but U.S.
integrated diplomatic and economic efforts have not been harnessed to compete globally with
China, which must not be treated as solely an Indo-Pacific threat.
it more or less likely that President Xi would seek to launch a war, blockade, or other coercive
act this decade. The United States must take immediate steps across economic, diplomatic, and
military fronts to make clear the U.S. will and capability to impose overwhelming consequences
in response to Chinese aggression.
Russia: A Chronic and Reconstituting Threat
The NDS describes Russia as the “acute threat,” in reference to Russia’s February 2022 invasion
of Ukraine. This term understates the threat from Russia by implying it is intense but limited
in duration. The threat Russia poses is chronic—ongoing and persistent. After the initial failure
of its incursion and subsequent reversal of territory it had occupied in Ukraine, Russia dug in

its lines of defense, greatly expanded its defense spending,9 ramped up defense production, and
plans to “massively expand its ground forces.”10 Indeed, it has already fielded a 15-percent larger
army than it had at the start of the war.11 It has brokered agreements for missiles and drones
from North Korea and Iran and is receiving massive economic and dual-use support from China.
Although Russia suffered an estimated 450,000 to 500,000 casualties and lost thousands of
tanks and armored vehicles by April 2024, 12 it maintains and has shown the ability to regenerate
substantial conventional power, and it maintains the largest nuclear arsenal in the world, addi-

would find to be a favorable outcome to the war. If Russia gains control over Ukraine, its border
(including Belarus) with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states would
stretch from the Arctic to the Black Sea, presenting significantly more demands for deployed
NATO forces. Russia would be an emboldened and likely stronger power, requiring NATO
to build and deploy additional forces, potentially at the expense of other locations where those
resources could be applied. The only viable course of action is to increase the scale, capability,
and freedom to use the materiel provided to Ukraine so that it can push Russia back. The White
House is right to make clear that any Russian use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass
destruction if Russia is losing conventionally would be met with “catastrophic consequences.”13

Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere.
Other Threat Actors: Iran, North Korea, Terrorism
Beyond China and Russia, the NDS lists other regional powers and terrorist groups that will
continue to present risk to the United States and its allies and states that, “[i]n service of our
strategic priorities, we will accept measured risk but remain vigilant in the face of other persis-

tary operation in Gaza will likely “have a generational impact on terrorism.”24 Already, armed
groups such as the Houthis have engaged in violence and aggressive actions against U.S. military
and commercial assets in the wake of Israel’s invasion of Gaza. The United States needs to pre-
serve intelligence resources and regional partnerships where terrorist groups operate, particularly
in the Middle East and Africa. The Commission notes that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghani-
stan poses the risk of a reconstituted terrorist threat, made difficult to manage by the lack of U.S.
or allied personnel.25
An Axis of Growing Malign Partnerships
Perhaps the most significant strategic development in recent years was the announcement by
Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping of a “no-limits” partnership in February 2022, on the threshold
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.26 That partnership has grown in the past two years to include
substantial Chinese underwriting of Russia’s war, including provision of machine tools and
microelectronics that are critical to Russian defense manufacturing while Russia evades sanc-
tions with energy sales to China. Beyond this partnership between the top two threats to the
United States, Iran and North Korea have cemented ties with Russia (and China), providing
missiles, drones, and other weapons to fuel Russian attacks on Ukraine. It is unclear what Russia
has given in return, but both Iran and North Korea stand to gain greatly from Russian military
technology and expertise.27
challenging U.S. leadership internationally. At minimum, the United States should assume that
if it enters a direct conflict involving Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea, that country will
benefit from economic and military aid from the others. We also believe that this partnership
increases the likelihood that a conflict with one would expand to multiple fronts, causing simul-
taneous demands on U.S. and allied resources. Efforts to isolate and coerce these states through
international means—such as sanctions, embargoes, and censure—will be far more difficult
with Russia and China’s alignment, whether at the United Nations or otherwise. Iran and North
Korea have already grown bolder in their threats and aggression due to their powerful supporters.

Threats to the Homeland, Cyberspace, and Space
Among the largest shifts in the threats to the United States is the risk of attack against the U.S.
homeland. The NDS rightfully lists defending the U.S. homeland as its top defense priority and
notes that U.S. competitors include threatening the U.S. homeland in their doctrine.28 In the
same way that the threat of terrorism was not widely understood or appreciated before 9/11, we
believe that this new threat to the homeland and its implications are not well understood by the
American public, integrated into planning, or resourced adequately.
basis. To date, China and Russia—the most capable foreign cyber actors—have chosen to limit
the damage to U.S. networks and operation of critical infrastructure, but they have both sought
to have such a capability in place.29 War with a peer or near-peer would be devastating. The
homeland dimension would likely include cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, poten-
tially affecting the availability of power, water, wastewater, and the systems that underpin U.S.
economic, transportation, and financial systems. Access to critical minerals and goods needed to
run the U.S. economy and build weapon systems would be completely cut off. Major war would
affect the life of every American in ways we can only begin to imagine.
domestic—as well as Russia, China, and North Korea’s expanding ability to deliver nuclear
weapons against the United States and its territories. Both China and Russia also have the capa-
bility to deploy air and maritime assets close to U.S. borders. DoD military planners and U.S.
Northern Command need to prepare for a worst-case scenario in which nuclear and other strikes
are launched against the United States, which could be done in large numbers and with special-
ized delivery systems. This topic has been covered extensively and expertly by the Congressional
Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, and we very much share that com-
mission’s view of the threat and its recommendations, including on the need to enhance missile
defense for the homeland and modernize all three legs of the U.S. nuclear triad.30

on space capabilities and have developed capabilities to hold at risk, disable, and destroy U.S.

the commercial sector. Fortunately, the United States possesses the most robust and dynamic
civil space industry in the world. The U.S. government should expand investment to diversify

side DoD, as well as commercial providers and citizen engagement. The United States cannot
win in conflict against a peer adversary with DoD military strength alone and must integrate
planning across its defense and nondefense government agencies. The military’s dependence on
privately owned and operated critical infrastructure needs further exploration and planning.
Legislation, regulation, and policy remain insufficient for the complex interagency and public-
private authorities and responsibilities for infrastructure protection, space, and territorial defense.
Other Threats
The NDS lists other transborder threats, including climate change, pandemics, and instability
caused by technological advance. These threats also affect the ability, readiness, and resilience of
the U.S. military to fight when needed. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
demonstrated that, in a national emergency, DoD will likely be called on for domestic missions,
which could negatively affect readiness for warfighting missions. Similarly, the National Guard
has increasingly been used to fight natural disasters, especially wildfire in the Western United
States.33 DoD estimates that roughly 1,700 of its 5,000 military installations worldwide are,
or may be, at risk of sea-level rise and extreme weather events.34 The Commission believes that
DoD is taking seriously the implications of climate change for its missions, including focused
attention on the opening of the Arctic, although this work will necessarily increase as the effects
of climate change accelerate.35

of their GDP in 2024, up from only three in 2014.37 After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO
increased its force structure, predominantly in Eastern Europe, to eight standing battlegroups,
along with the ability to surge.38 NATO allies must continue this trend and ensure that defense
spending translates operationally to a significantly larger pool of ready forces and force posture
in Eastern Europe, as well as decreased reliance on the United States for military operations in
conflict, all in alignment with NATO’s new force plans. Beyond spending, the Commission
applauds DoD’s role in forming and hosting two multilateral efforts to organize and coordinate
military training, intelligence-sharing, and provision of weapons and equipment to Ukraine:
the Security Assistance Group–Ukraine and the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (Ramstein
Forum). These efforts demonstrate unique U.S. leadership capabilities and the power of opera-
tionalizing alliances. The United States must retain its leadership role in the alliance, providing
forces and the enabling capabilities needed and maintaining the alliance’s nuclear deterrence,

ships in Asia, driven in response to Chinese provocations. Efforts such as AUKUS; the Quad;
strengthening trilaterally ties among Japan, South Korea, and the United States; and expanding
the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the Philippines are critical for deterrence
and, in many cases, provide significant operational benefits. Several nations in the Indo-Pacific,
notably Japan and Australia, are substantially increasing defense posture and investments.
Importantly, Congress extended the Compacts of Free Association with the Federated States of
Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. Additional efforts
are needed, including enabling Taiwan to strengthen its self-defenses, preparing and hardening
military facilities on allied territory, sharing military technology where feasible, and upgrading
U.S. Forces Japan to a four-star operational command.

cement diplomatic breakthroughs between Israel and Arab states and to develop security archi-
tectures should be nurtured. The impressive success by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)
at coordinating integrated air defense for Israel in the face of large-scale Iranian attack is an
important example of a military partnership in the region.
Technolog y
Finally, the Commission reiterates the refrain that the pace of technological change is greater
than at any other time in U.S. history, presenting both opportunities for major advances for the
world’s benefit and threats to national security. We discuss the implications of this technological
transformation in Chapter 5, especially in terms of the dire need for DoD to maintain a tech-
savvy workforce and become more agile in identifying, promoting, and adopting new technolo-
gies, at scale, that are predominantly being developed outside government control. The Com-
mission believes DoD’s successful adoption of new technology is critical to strengthen deterrence
and the ability to prevail, if needed, in conflict.
Chapter 3
Domestic Constraints and Visions of
Success
Although the NDS was written to address the international strategic environment, it is also
shaped by domestic constraints on what the U.S. government and DoD can and should do. In
some cases, the NDS is explicit about these constraints: It calls the defense acquisition system
“too slow and too focused on acquiring systems not designed to address the most critical chal-
lenges we face” and says that, to “recruit and retain the most talented Americans, we must
change our institutional culture and reform how we do business.”1
budget imposes limits on force size and structure; the weakness of the defense industrial base
(DIB) constrains rapid growth of platforms, munitions, and other needed equipment; and the
domestic political climate complicates recruitment and distracts from crucial security issues.
As an independent body, the Commission has the flexibility and the responsibility to be more
explicit in discussing these limitations and laying out aspirational visions of success.
Department of Defense
The Commission agrees strongly with the admonition from Secretary Austin in his introduction
to the NDS that “business as usual at the Department is not acceptable,”2 but we see continuing
evidence that the “barnacles of bureaucracy” are slowing change and innovation.3 In one estima-
tion, the largest challenge to achieving the goals laid out in the NDS is the business practices of
DoD itself.4 The Commission saw several examples of DoD implementing new concepts and
experimenting with different ways to do business, but these tend to be at the margins, as end-

runs around the typical processes, and at small scale rather than overhauling central personnel,
research and development (R&D), and procurement mechanisms or acting at the scale required.
As expected, smaller units can change faster than large ones: U.S. Special Operations Com-
mand’s (SOCOM’s) acquisition model outpaces that of the services; the Space Force has a more
agile personnel system than the Air Force; and the Marine Corps has shifted its entire vision
faster than the Navy. Too often at DoD, significant change only takes place with the sustained,
direct involvement of the Secretary or Deputy Secretary.5 Such leadership is vital to the effective-
ness of the department, but personalized efforts cannot possibly scale to all the change needed.
Vision of Success
There are examples in U.S. defense history marked by the kind of urgent action needed, such as
the naval expansion that began in the late 1930s and continued through World War II; the mas-
sive expansion of U.S. aircraft, tank, and munitions production during World War II; the Man-
hattan Project, which yielded the atomic bomb; Project Atlas, which produced the first inter-
continental ballistic missile; the rapid fielding of the U-2 and SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft; and
the development of concepts and capabilities in the 1980s that helped bring about the end of the
Cold War. The common element among these moments was an appreciation of the threat and a
need for urgent action, willingness to take risk, and streamlined requirements focused on achiev-
ing essential capability. Equally important was the willingness of senior leaders to drive change
through the bureaucracy with the backing of Congress. We believe that the threat today matches
those earlier periods and requires the same level of action but that this action will only come
from concerted leadership. It also requires the systematic change of incentives: for example, for
the acquisition workforce to feel more pressure to bring new technology and equipment online
faster instead of pressure to prevent cost overruns regardless of schedule or capability.
Integration with the Rest of the U.S. Government
The NDS rests on the concept of integrated deterrence, which presumes integration throughout
the executive branch and beyond. The concept is also highlighted in the National Security Strat-
eg y.6 Integrated deterrence requires that other departments and agencies have the same priorities
and the organizational culture and capacity to be full partners—and that DoD is effective in
pursuing integration with those organizations. More progress is needed in this regard.

ment lacks a similar level of planning, joint operations, and shared undertaking for national
security in other parts, including the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), the economic departments (including Treasury, Commerce, and the
Small Business Administration), and those supporting the development of a strong U.S. work-
force, such as Labor and Education. Just as was the case in the Cold War, these departments and
agencies must have the strategic focus on competition, now on China in particular.
matic, economic, military, and information efforts to further their national security interests.
Certainly, the U.S. democratic and capitalist system demands some checks on direction to that
extent, but we believe that recent administrations of both political parties have not pursued
a comprehensive approach to national security. The National Security Council should play a
stronger integration role. This includes an interagency planning process that complements mili-
tary operation plans with diplomatic, economic, and communications tools in conjunction with
allies and partners.
Vision of Success
The National Security Council should spearhead an interagency planning process, provide
clear guidance, and coordinate actions across departments at the highest levels to employ dip-
lomatic, economic, and military resources. Departments such as Labor and Education should
feel a responsibility to provide a workforce suited to public and private sector work in support of
national security objectives. Departments that were critical to winning the Cold War—State,
USAID, the U.S. Information Agency, and others—should be refocused on the security chal-
lenges described above and, where needed, resourced to fully engage in this mission.
Defense Industrial Base and Technological Innovation
The DIB is currently unable to produce the weapons, munitions, and other equipment and soft-
ware needed to prepare for and engage in great power conflict. Consolidation and underinvest-
ment have led to too few companies, gaps in the workforce, insufficient production infrastruc-
ture, and fragile supply chains.
tion that relies on large “programs of record” that lack flexibility and restrict development and
updates to limited industrial partners. Numerous reports have observed DoD’s innovation adop-
tion problems, all of which note that most technological advances, including in the majority of
the fields DoD calls fundamental to its success, are occurring in the private sector due to the
shift from government to private R&D funding.7 DoD has responded with several initiatives,

notably including the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and multiple service-level innovation and
rapid acquisition offices, but these receive far less funding and exist outside DoD’s budgeting
and execution processes. The Office of Strategic Capital (OSC), created to add loans and loan
guarantees as methods for funding private sector production, is an innovative approach with the
potential to leverage capital with relatively small government outlays.
Vision of Success
Defense funding should be robust and stable in order to build and maintain additional production
capacity, including surge capacity in time of wartime mobilization. DoD should spend the major-
ity of its R&D and procurement funds on modern technology that can be updated and modern-
ized easily and at low cost. DoD should recognize the value of software and better organize its
business practices accordingly. Companies should see an incentive and patriotic duty to work with
DoD, be freed from excessive regulation, and be allowed to innovate to solve problems rather than
meet overly engineered requirements. DoD and the DIB should work productively with counter-
parts in other nations, increasing coproduction and removing restrictions that prevent DoD from
buying products from other nations in cases where domestic capacity is insufficient.
Congress
Congress, as it has come to function in recent years, has become a major impediment to national
security. It routinely fails in its basic job of funding the government on time, instead relying on
continuing resolutions that waste billions of taxpayer dollars and, perhaps worse, time.8 Govern-
ment shutdowns and automatic sequesters deprive agencies of necessary funding and inject chaos
into planning and operations. The extended delay through 2023 and early 2024 in providing
needed assistance to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the DIB, despite such assistance eventually
passing overwhelmingly in both chambers, demonstrated a lack of political resolve, willingness
to jumpstart U.S. industry, and support for critical U.S. allies and partners.

It had a full-year appropriation only one year, FY 2019. DoD reported the financial impacts of these continu-
ing resolutions in FYs 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018, reporting that the amount of funding “locked up” by these
continuing resolutions accounted for $37.8 billion in continuing funding for programs that was no longer

cies to move faster, take risks, and achieve results in short time frames. Positive examples of con-
gressional action include creating the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and demanding attention on
shortfalls in U.S. shipbuilding capacity. We urge Congress to maintain this mindset rather than
protecting legacy programs and focusing oversight on failures instead of how to succeed.
Vision of Success
We recommend measures introduced in Congress and suggested by other commissions to reduce
the harm done by restrictions imposed by continuing resolutions, including the ability to start
new initiatives and shift funding below agreed-upon thresholds, and to prevent government shut-
downs.9 We recommend that Congress remove, as it does periodically, some civilian positions
from the requirement of Senate confirmation and recommend that Congress review whether
military promotions and rotations below the three-star level can be processed more routinely and
quickly, as with confirmation of lower-level officers.10 Civilian DoD nominees, ambassadors,
and other positions outside the military that are necessary for national security should also be
expedited for confirmation in the Senate.
Resources
The NDS is, on its face, independent of budget considerations (often called “budget-informed”
but not “budget-driven”) but is inherently constrained by past, present, and future levels of invest-
ment. Over time, budget limitations have restricted procurement to rates lower than needed,
robbed spending on munitions, reduced readiness, and forced prioritizations over the locations
and amounts of U.S. presence (military, intelligence, and diplomatic) around the world, among
other things. The current defense budget of $850 billion is undeniably a large amount and can
be spent more effectively and efficiently, as detailed later in this report. Finding savings, making
reinvestments, and reforming processes to become more efficient and get more capability per
dollar are all necessary. However, these improvements would not obviate the need to spend not

just better but more, given the low level of defense spending compared with times in the past
century of similar risk.
Vision of Success
Congress should revoke or override the caps in the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act. For FY 2025,
real growth in defense and nondefense national security spending is needed and, at a bare mini-
mum, should fall within the range recommended by the 2018 NDS Commission. While other
reforms described elsewhere in this report are being made, increased spending should be allo-
cated to prioritize near-term readiness demands to restore and reinforce deterrence. Supplemen-
tal funds should begin a multiyear capital investment in additional capacity, including growing
the capacity of the industrial base. Future defense budgets should put defense and other compo-
nents of national security on a glide path to support efforts commensurate with the U.S. national
effort seen during the Cold War. Larger amounts of defense spending should be accompanied by
sufficient resources to build capacity at other departments and agencies that contribute elements
to national power.
Domestic Disengagement, Need for Public Engagement
The Commission heard in numerous meetings with current and former officials that the polar-
ization of U.S. domestic politics is harming the U.S. military and U.S. national security. We are
concerned that the traditional post–World War II bipartisan support for a strong military, pres-
ervation of alliances, and engagement in international affairs is waning, as was on display in the
monthslong delay before Congress ultimately approved a supplemental appropriations request
for Ukraine, Israel, and other purposes.
rorism, the American public see current national security challenges as remote. There is a dire
need to better educate the American public to the nature of the threats (including to the home-
land), the importance of U.S. global engagement, and what it will take in terms of personnel,
funding, and (potentially) diversion from normal civic and economic life if deterrence fails.
Vision of Success
U.S. leaders must make the case publicly why these challenges matter and why the United States
remains the indispensable nation to maintain peace, stability, and a flourishing economy. This
begins with the President, the Congress, and the cabinet but extends to civic and economic lead-
ers, the media, and others who influence the public. Success in this regard looks like increased
civic and public service, informed debate about foreign affairs and national security, and an
understanding of how American life depends on, and is increasingly part of, U.S. national secu-
rity. The “all elements” effort requires the support of the public for mobilization of the econ-
omy; broader volunteering in military, public, and civic service; and the willingness to sacrifice
through taxation and possible changes to entitlement benefits so the nation can afford the cost
of global leadership.
Chapter 4
Creating an All Elements of National
Power Approach to Defense
The NDS calls for integration, noting, “Integrated deterrence means using every tool at the
Department’s disposal, in close collaboration with our counterparts across the U.S. government
and with Allies and partners, to ensure that potential foes understand the folly of aggression.”1
The NDS, like the NSS, recognizes that DoD cannot achieve U.S. national defense goals alone
and acknowledges that some activities are better undertaken by other U.S. departments and
agencies or can be done more effectively or efficiently by allies or with the private sector.

stan. Fighting an actual conflict with a peer competitor, such as China or Russia, would be
fundamentally different and would affect the life of every American in ways we can only
begin to imagine. The U.S. homeland would be a target—at minimum, through disruptions
to critical infrastructure supporting the war effort, but likely with significant public impact.
A conflict with a global power would result in economic impacts from disruptions to supply
chains and global trade that would be felt by nearly every American. War would also require
increased manpower, including substantial use of the Reserve Component and National
Guard, at a time when the viability of the all-volunteer force is facing serious questions.3 It
would require substantially more defense production, likely including invoking the Defense

munism at the height of the Cold War, when there was unity of action across the government;
common purpose across the aisle in Congress; a focus in the U.S. educational, labor, and busi-
ness sectors; and a public who supported public service and an internationalist U.S. strategy.
We believe the threat today matches that of the Cold War, and it is time to return to such an
approach to prepare.
All of Government
The first step in building a comprehensive approach to national defense is better coordinating
and integrating the efforts within the executive branch.4
the Commission concludes that strategic coordination across departments and agencies is lack-
ing. There are silos of effort—diplomatic, foreign aid, military, and other—that are episodically

the State Department has the same focus on China and Russia as the top threats to U.S. security
that DoD has, nor does the State Department have a holistic diplomatic approach to compete
with those countries globally. Embassies have a narrow view based on one country and may
not be focused on the advances of China or Russia, for example, in that country. We recom-
mend that Congress provide adequate funding for the State Department, requiring it to develop
and implement a national security–focused diplomatic strategy that incorporates USAID’s for-
eign assistance tools.7 Congress should also return to the practice that was common before the

Allies and Partners
The NDS describes allies and partners as “foundational” to U.S. national security and the ability
of DoD to deter and engage in combat.20 We wholeheartedly agree and believe that these nations
are, along with the American people, the most important U.S. advantage over China and Russia.
Such cooperation requires moving beyond allies and partners providing access, basing, and over-
flight and toward demonstrating integrated and combined capability, interoperability in employ-
ing that capability, and the collective resolve to do so.
strengthen ties with foreign allies and partners. Increased defense spending by NATO and other
allies (e.g., Japan), the AUKUS agreement, trilateral relations with Japan and South Korea, and
access agreements in the Philippines are a few of the significant recent developments, though
these efforts will require work and resources to operationalize.
keeping with the previous section, we recommend expanding the use of commercial and cul-
tural relationships, financial instruments, energy policy, shared views on environmental risk,
and anything else in the toolbox by which the United States can promote shared interests and
draw contrasts with China and Russia.

Chapter 5
Innovation at DoD in Technology,
Concepts, and Approaches
In light of the strategic environment described above, technological change, and the evolving
character of war, DoD and the Joint Force will need to make far-reaching changes to the way
they operate. The NDS recognizes this imperative for innovation and change, citing a need for
“overhauling the Department’s force development, design, and business management practices.”1
Technology and Technology Adoption
The U.S. military, underpinned by the national security innovation base, has employed cutting-
edge technology to its decisive advantage for decades. The assumption of uncontested techno-
logical superiority has given the United States the luxury to build exquisite capabilities, with long
acquisition cycles and little tolerance for failure or risk. Given that peer-level competitors (such
as China) are incorporating technology at accelerating speed and that even relatively unsophis-
ticated actors (such as the Houthis) are able to obtain and use modern technology (e.g., drones)
to strategic effect, DoD will have to continue to develop, adopt, and iterate new technologies at
greater speed and scale and at an affordable cost.
defense-funded organizations and traditional defense companies.2 This does not reflect today’s
innovation environment, which exists across the private sector and is largely driven by commer-
cial interests. Effectively harnessing the national security potential of this new environment will
place the United States (and others) on the cusp of a revolution in military affairs. To illustrate
this dynamic, DoD has identified 14 critical technologies that are “vital to maintaining the

United States’ national security.”3 Of the 14, only three (directed energy, hypersonics, and inte-
grated sensing and cyber) are defense specific; the others are emerging fields and areas where the
private sector plays the lead role in research, development, and implementation and where DoD
needs to focus on adopting and adapting technology rather than driving its innovation.4

but DoD has had difficulty for years in implementing this vision.5 In 2018, the Defense Innova-
tion Board noted that DoD does not have an innovation problem, it has an innovation adoption
problem.6 This remains true today; as the Director of DIU wrote in releasing DIU 3.0, “we can
and must do more to identify and adopt impactful commercial technologies at speed and scale.”7

DoD leaders and Congress to replace legal, regulatory, and cultural barriers with the mindset
and exhortation to solicit, identify, test, procure, and adapt new technology. Several government
and external organizations have provided useful recommendations to improve adoption of tech-
nical innovation; we recommend that the Secretary of Defense establish a team, with congres-
sional involvement, dedicated to developing an implementation plan for this transformation.9

tives are reversed, driven by the financial motivations to solve operational problems quickly.
But identifying and adopting new technology, especially as provided by less traditional suppli-
ers, is disruptive. The Commission believes that DoD needs to better identify the operational
capabilities it needs rather than establish overly prescribed technical requirements. Private sector
companies can then propose existing or developing technology to meet those requirements in
creative ways. This shift is facilitated by more consistent use of open standards and leveraging
the idea of modular open system architecture.10 Such an approach will separate the development
of hardware from software, enable more-rapid upgrades, and help diversify the industrial base.

reduced the average time to process an application for a security clearance,11 but the system still

also appreciates the side benefits of Replicator: demonstrating that rapid procurement can be
done, streamlining the requirements process, building trust with Congress, and fostering inno-
vation and collaboration in the defense industry. The Commission applauds Deputy Secretary
Hicks and Vice Chairman Christopher Grady for driving the cultural change necessary inside
the Pentagon and recommends that DoD document and apply lessons from this initiative so it
can scale to solve other emerging operational needs without requiring the same level of attention

fighting. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council is charged with assessing joint capabilities

the services or industry to identify, acquire, or fund such programs.17
global and coordinated efforts of U.S. adversaries. Given that China and Russia operate across
multiple theaters and given the partnerships among U.S. adversaries, coordination and integra-
tion across U.S. geographic commands must be stronger and must better reflect the increased
threat and potential for military conflict in U.S. Northern Command’s (NORTHCOM’s) area
of responsibility. The Commission also notes that the functional commands—U.S. Strategic
Command, U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), U.S. Cyber Command (CYBER-
COM), and SOCOM—are integral to deterrence, campaigning, and warfighting. Operational
plans, however, are more centered on geographic commands and may not take into account com-
peting demands on the functional commands across multiple theaters. The importance of align-
ment in the UCP was demonstrated by CENTCOM’s efforts to coordinate air defense around
Israel, which would have been made more difficult if military responsibility for Israel and its
neighbors was still under different commands.
conflicts illustrates the disconnect within DoD’s structure, particularly between the combatant
commands and the services. The Commission recommends an evaluation of the organizational
structure and roles and missions to identify areas for improvement and evolution, including fur-
ther changes to the UCP. We also recommend aligning the allocation of regional responsibilities
at DoD and the Department of State.
Warfighting Operational Concepts
As U.S. warfighting advantages are eroding in key domains, the United States sorely needs inno-
vative operational concepts that create dilemmas for and impose constraints on adversaries while
expanding U.S. options to gain or sustain a competitive edge. Emerging technologies provide
new opportunities for such concepts.

The JWC falls short of prescribing how forces will fight and instead offers a high-level vision of

challenges, retain core areas of American advantage, and impose challenges on U.S. adversaries.
concepts to achieve strategic advantage to prevail in future conflicts. These constructs must
address gaps in existing operational concepts to focus on closing kill chains, fully integrating
space and cyber operations, deploying emerging capabilities, considering conventional-nuclear
integration, and more effectively integrating allies and partners.21 New concepts should be devel-
oped for contested logistics and protracted war, as distinct operational concepts will be required
at different periods of the conflict to sustain a U.S. competitive advantage.22 New operational
concepts must also incorporate emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and
autonomous systems, as these technologies are fundamentally changing modern warfare. Opera-
tional concepts must take advantage of these and other technologies to present new challenges to
adversaries, harness opportunities provided by the speed of rapid decisionmaking, and close gaps
in integration within the Joint Force and with allies through interoperable technology. Lastly,
the Commission believes DoD should seek to better align its concepts with other parts of the
interagency to better coordinate military tools and other instruments of national power in pur-
suit of integrated deterrence.

ized to ensure that it continues beyond the current Pentagon leadership.24 Without continued
improvements to and investments in strategic analysis and concept development, DoD’s ability
to translate the strategic objectives laid out in the NDS to operational concepts and investments
in technology and capability will be unsound.
Closing the Operational-Industrial Planning Gap
DoD faces a disconnect between its operational planning and its industrial planning. The war
in Ukraine is a reminder that modern warfare at industrial scale requires a tight connection
between the needs of warfighters and the priorities of industrial base policy. Mobilizing the U.S.
industry in the event of a protracted conflict requires DoD, as well as interagency and industry
partners, to engage in detailed planning tailored to specific contingencies.

however, is primarily the responsibility of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment and the military services.
lines. Campaign and contingency plans are reviewed and revised on a frequent basis, with a
focus on near-term horizons and largely limited to forces or resources that are already available or
assumed to be available when a crisis arises.25 Defense industrial planning often involves multiple
budget cycles.26 Furthermore, a DoD contingency plan (e.g., an operational plan) will specify
the types and quantities of munitions required but might not provide specific courses of action

DoD needs to bridge this operational-industrial gap and incorporate the DIB into both its strat-
egy and its operational planning. DoD must also review its operation plans, and assumptions for
supporting allies, to ensure that they adequately recognize the likelihood of protracted conflict.
Overly optimistic estimates for conflict to end quickly or to require fewer weapons, platforms,

Force Sizing, Capabilities, and Posture
The United States and its allies face two ongoing wars, with the prospect of a third, potentially
more serious one looming on the horizon. Consequently, the United States and its allies need to
be sized, postured, and equipped to tackle this multisided threat.
An Out-of-Date Force-Sizing Construct
From World War II until the past decade, the United States sized its military to fight two wars
simultaneously.1 The 2022 NDS—much like its 2018 predecessor—“sizes and shapes the Joint
force to simultaneously defend the homeland; maintain strategic deterrence; and deter, and if
necessary prevail in conflict” while still “deter[ring] opportunistic aggression elsewhere.”2 In
other words, the 2022 NDS argues that the United States should be able to defeat aggression by
a major power while deterring conflicts in other parts of the world.3

China and Russia independently have global reach and have committed to a “no-limits friend-
ship,” with additional partnerships developing with North Korea and Iran, as described previ-
ously. As U.S. adversaries are cooperating more closely together than before, the United States
and its allies must be prepared to confront an axis of multiple adversaries. Not building a force
construct that is appropriately resourced and sufficiently agile to deal with this environment
could deter the United States from committing itself in any one theater, given the threat of con-
flicts in other theaters. As a defense strategist warned, “A force that can only wage one conflict

global and prioritized. Such an approach must be grounded in the premise that the United States
is a global power with global interests and commitments. An exclusive focus on a single adversary
or single region, as some have suggested, is a fundamentally flawed response to the global nature
of challenges posed by such adversaries as China and Russia and to the growing cooperation
between adversaries across regions. That said, the United States’ force-planning approach must
be prioritized to effectively and efficiently allocate finite resources, address threats of varying
scope and scale, and ensure a mix of U.S. instruments of national power that are tailored to spe-
cific strategic objectives. The Commission cautions that attempts to prioritize by suddenly and
drastically reducing U.S. military presence in a particular region are unlikely to be effective or
sustainable and may eventually require larger and more expensive force deployments.

States and its allies, all five adversaries threaten vital American interests and cannot be ignored.
Attempts to deprioritize theaters and significantly reduce U.S. presence—notably in Europe and
the Middle East—have emboldened U.S. adversaries and required the United States to surge

Force Sizing and Capabilities
Although the Commission was not resourced to do a comprehensive analysis of all the com-
posite elements of force structure, we outline some of most important components of the
future force.
U.S. Navy
Given the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and the centrality of the maritime domain, par-
ticularly to the Indo-Pacific but also to the Middle East and Europe, the Commission remains
gravely concerned by the diminishing size of the U.S. Navy. The fleet has had fewer than 300
manned ships each year since 2003,8 and the Navy’s ability to maintain and upgrade the ships it
has remains a concern.9 For several years, the Navy has produced assessments calling for fleets of
321 to 404 manned ships, with more recent plans also calling for substantial numbers of large,
unmanned surface and subsurface ships.10 Because of anemic funding and DIB constraints, the
path to get to the larger fleet remains unclear at best. Even with steady budgetary growth, the
Navy will still only have 330 ships in the mid-2030s and peak at 377 ships in FY 2045.11
surface, and subsurface—to conduct and support a variety of missions, including surveillance,
transport, refueling, and combat operations. Task Force 59 in the Fifth Fleet has demonstrated

manned ships and 45 to 204 large, uncrewed vessels. Finally, the June 2023 Battle Force Ship Assessment and
Requirement report called for 381 manned ships and 134 uncrewed vessels (O’Rourke, Navy Force Structure
and Shipbuilding Plans, p. 3).

the capability of these systems, but there are questions about whether the Navy has embraced
autonomous systems as complements to the manned fleet.12 The Commission recommends that
the Navy expands its development, procurement, and operational concepts to employ these capa-
bilities as part of the future fleet.
able for operations or combat because of maintenance and repair that take too long.13
Virginia-class attack submarine is often considered the cornerstone of the Indo-Pacific fight and is
a core component of AUKUS, but the FY 2025 budget decreased the request from two submarines
to one, citing budget and industrial base concerns.14 At the same time, the Ukraine war has high-
lighted the vulnerability of large surface combatants to antiship missiles and uncrewed surface
vessels.15 This vulnerability further underscores the need for the fleet to be able to strike on mass
at longer ranges through a mixture of uncrewed vessels and aircraft and longer-range munitions.
Navy in recent years, specifically addressing the gaps in undersea capabilities, and to include
and integrate a sizable number of uncrewed vessels. The Commission recommends substantial
investment elsewhere in shipbuilding, depot, and maintenance infrastructure, as well as procure-
ment of ships from allies to supplement U.S. production, which will all be necessary to reach any
of the fleet sizes proposed by the Navy in the time frame demanded by the threat. The Commis-
sion recognizes that Congress has empaneled a separate Commission on the Future of the Navy
with the mandate to, among other things, make recommendations on the size and mixture of
the Navy fleet.
U.S. Marine Corps
Of the services, the Marine Corps deserves the most credit for embracing the 2018 NDS’s direc-
tion to refocus on great power competition and the nature of future warfighting. Despite the
controversy, the Marine Corps’ Force Design 2030 offers a coherent way for the Marine Corps
to operate in the Indo-Pacific against the pacing threat while retaining the ability to serve as
the nation’s emergency response for crises as they materialize.16 The service deserves high marks
for displaying the agility that DoD often yearns for but rarely achieves. As the United States
confronts an increasingly tumultuous and unpredictable world, the Marine Corps’ role remains
as important as ever, and the service needs to preserve its ability to respond quickly outside the
Indo-Pacific as the need arises.

U.S. Air Force
The U.S. Air Force is at the forefront of a host of missions: from defending the homeland; to
projecting power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East; to providing the operational
reach and intelligence support that allows the rest of the Joint Force to function. Unfortunately,
the size of the service (as measured in either personnel or aircraft) has stagnated, if not declined.17
Many of its platforms have been suffered from lackluster mission capable rates, meaning that
only a fraction of the force is actually ready for combat at a given time.18 While the service has
new capabilities—such as the B-21—under development, these capabilities are still years away
from fully coming online.19
both its capacity and its capabilities. To its credit, the Department of the Air Force is in the
midst of an effort, that is necessary but not sufficient, to better structure itself for great power
competition, but preparing the service for future threats will require more than just a reorga-
nization.20 In particular, the Commission recommends supporting the Collaborative Combat
Aircraft program. We encourage the service to invest more in attritable and runway independent
aircraft to increase platforms and operate in environments in which adversaries will target air
bases. The Commission also supports the Air Force’s investments in Next Generation Air Domi-
nance fighter aircraft, the Next Generation Air-Refueling System, and autonomy and basing to
prepare the service for the future fight. The service also needs to increase its air base defenses,
both passive and active, in order to operate against such adversaries as China or Russia. Finally,
the Air Force plays important roles in all theaters—including the Middle East, Africa, and South
America—so the service needs to maintain sufficient aircraft to support those requirements, but
generally with less sophisticated, more cost-effective solutions.
U.S. Army
Landpower remains central to American security, no matter the adversary or theater. In large-
scale operations, the Army remains critical to dominating adversaries and enabling the Joint
Force. The FY 2025 budget request proposed reducing the Army’s end strength to 443,000,
down from a recent high in FY 2021 of 486,000, continuing a decrease over the past three years
largely caused by recruiting and budget shortfalls.21 The FY 2025 budget request contains no
growth in funding from current levels. The Commission believes that this force size is insuf-
ficient. Although the use of technology, operational concepts, and mission requirements should
inform the size of the Army, we believe that a force size prior to the recent reductions would be

more appropriate. The Army budget would need to grow in real terms to support sufficient per-
sonnel, operations, readiness, and modernization.22
structure in key areas—particularly air defense, counter–unmanned aerial systems, electronic
warfare, and long-range fires—that are applicable across theaters, including in a Western Pacific
contingency. As the Ukraine war also demonstrates, there is still very much a need for heavy
armored forces, particularly in Europe but also likely in a Korean Peninsula contingency. More-
over, as the Israel-Hamas war demonstrates, the Iranian and violent extremist organization
threats necessitate continued investments in special operations forces and security force assis-
tance brigades to build partner capacity. Both conflicts further demonstrate the Army’s central
role in assuring allies and partners through forward presence and exercises. Finally, the Army
continues to play a critical role in logistics and sustainment—across all the theaters—enabling
the Joint Force to project power and then sustain its ability to fight.
U.S. Space Force
Space has emerged as a critical asymmetric advantage in modern warfare, underpinning nearly
all military operations. From communications; to position, navigation, and timing; to intelli-
gence, space undergirds how the Joint Force fights. With China, Russia, and other U.S. adversar-
ies fielding antisatellite capabilities to hold U.S assets at risk, space increasingly is a warfighting
domain in its own right. The Commission is encouraged by the efforts of a relatively new service
and combatant command: the U.S. Space Force and U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM); both
must be given continued attention and resources as they organize, bolster space defense and resil-
iency, and present forces to the Joint Force.
domain, the Commission recommends continued investment in diversifying and dispersing sat-
ellite constellations, developing redundant communication pathways, enhancing cybersecurity
measures for space systems, investing in on-orbit defensive and offensive capabilities, and foster-
ing international cooperation to enhance the resiliency of U.S. space capabilities. The Commis-
sion also encourages the Space Force and SPACECOM to work in close partnership with com-
mercial and international partners.23 As the Ukraine war demonstrates, commercial space offers
significant potential to augment existing government systems, and the United States should
continue to expand this area of American advantage.
22 Army active duty end strengths before 9/11 and after the surge for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq fluc-
tuated between 475,000 and 490,000 and reached a peak of 556,000 in 2010 and 2011. The 2014 National
Defense Panel recommended that the “Army and Marine Corps should not be reduced below their pre-9/11
end-strengths—490,000 active duty soldiers in the Army and 182,000 active Marines” (Perry et al., Ensuring
a Strong U.S. Defense for the Future, p. 49). See Kapp, “FY2023 NDAA”; and Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense (Comptroller), National Defense Budget Estimates for Fiscal Year 2024, pp. 288–290.

ration and has restricted information-sharing within the U.S. government. The Commission recognizes recent
DoD efforts to address overclassification and encourages continued policy and operation attention on this
effort.
The National Guard and Reserve Component
The Reserve Component, including the National Guard, plays an increasingly important role
as part of the Total Force. The Reserve Component offers the Joint Force the ability to read-
ily expand the size of the active force in wartime and plays a vital role in day-to-day operations
in all major theaters of concern. The National Guard’s State Partnership Program with more
than 100 countries all over the world is a key element of great power competition and provides
a way to foster military-to-military ties. Indeed, the program deserves some of the credit for the
success in supporting Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022 invasion.24 At the same time, the
National Guard plays an increasingly important role in homeland defense and responding to
crises at home, particularly as natural disasters become increasingly frequent and more devastat-
ing. However, restrictions within the Executive Order invoking this statutory authority limit
the flexibility of the Secretary of Defense to activate Reserve Component members beyond the
3,000 presently authorized; we recommend increasing this cap.
high-demand fields that DoD might not otherwise be able to tap. Especially given the likely size
and scale of great power war, it is vital that DoD maintains a robust and healthy reserve compo-
nent going forward. Moreover, unlike in previous eras, the United States cannot expect months
of strategic warning prior to conflict and therefore must invest in both the equipment and soldier
readiness levels needed to quickly mobilize and deploy the reserve component to theater, should
war break out.
Munitions
Previous NDS Commissions have warned that DoD has systematically underinvested in muni-
tions, choosing to raid these accounts as quick fixes to solve budget shortfalls. The Ukraine war
and the Israel-Hamas war, however, vividly demonstrate that modern wars are likely to be pro-
tracted and consume a lot of munitions, from the relatively basic 155-mm artillery rounds, to
Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, to air defense interceptors, and the United
States simply does not have enough of such munitions on hand. The Joint Force routinely uses
munitions that are significantly more expensive to produce than their targets, including in Oper-
ation Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea to maintain freedom of navigation. DoD needs to
develop additional options to keep the cost of munitions relative to the value of their intended
targets in check. To do this, DoD should embrace digital architecture, open architecture, and
modularity in munitions design and production.25 Over the longer term, directed energy has
particular promise to restore magazine depth at an affordable cost.26

C4ISR
C4ISR—command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance—provides the connective tissue that allows the services to operate together and
deliver effects as a Total Force. The increase in the total amount of information and the ability
of adversaries to complicate access to accurate information pose enormous challenges for situa-
tion awareness and decisionmaking in times of conflict. Although DoD is working to provide
connectivity across the different services, domains, and platforms, more work still needs to be
done before the Joint Force and civilian leadership can seamlessly share information, make sense
of it, and make good decisions. Considerably more work is needed to advance Combined Joint
All-Domain Command and Control from the “initial version [as] a minimum viable capability”
to an operational capability.27
given the need to integrate them into coalition operations.
Posture
The 2022 NDS directs the Joint Force to “optimize our posture for denial.”28 Accomplishing
this task requires fielding combat-credible forces in areas of potential conflict, ensuring the abil-
ity to move forces quickly under contested logistics, and investing in the functional commands
that would enable the United States to fight and win no matter the contingency.29 Force posture
for the various theaters is discussed below. The Commission also recommends that DoD review
its balance between rotational and permanently stationed forces and, when appropriate, shift to
the latter model—particularly in Europe—where permanently stationing forces would send an
added deterrence signal to U.S. adversaries and reassure U.S. allies.
The Homeland
As discussed above, a future conflict with a major power would likely involve attacks on the U.S.
homeland, particularly cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, disinformation campaigns,
and the possibility of kinetic strike. Because the large majority of critical infrastructure and
information systems fall outside the direct purview of DoD, defense of the homeland requires
effective integration and planning with other U.S. government departments and agencies, as
well as with the private sector. To defend these assets and to enable deployment of U.S. forces
and resources in a future conflict, the United States must invest in the resilience of its domestic
critical infrastructure.

other forces to defend the homeland.30 It needs to continue the Noble Eagle mission to defend
American airspace, bolster its air and missile defense, and increase air and sea domain aware-
ness to detect threats. In particular, DoD will need to be able to counter new and emerging
threats to the homeland—including hypersonics and unmanned aerial systems. Importantly,
DoD needs to ensure that these assets remain dedicated to homeland defense and not double-
tapped to project for oversea contingencies, since the homeland will likely remain at risk for
the duration of a conflict.
resources to engage adversaries in cyberspace to help protect U.S. critical infrastructure from
attack. Given that much of the critical infrastructure that the United States relies on for power
projection overseas falls outside DoD’s remit, the department needs to further its integration
with and increase the capability of other parts of the U.S. government, including DHS and
its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the intelligence community, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and state and local governments.
The Indo-Pacific
With four of the five NDS-named adversaries present, the Indo-Pacific remains not only the
largest but potentially the most dangerous theater of concern. There has been impressive prog-
ress in enhancing cooperation with Australia, Japan, and India and gaining greater access to
the Philippines, among other efforts, which will strengthen U.S. allies and deterrence and, over
time, will create more ability for the United States to fight jointly in the region. At the same time,
however, China has increased aggression toward Taiwan and in the East China Sea and South
China Sea and is attempting to create new patterns of behavior in the region to its advantage and
to reduce warning time, should it decide to engage in more aggressive action.
essary, prevail in conflict requires an urgent increase in force structure and access. In terms of
forces, the United States will need more undersea assets (particularly Virginia-class submarines
but also large, uncrewed underwater vessels); long-range bombers with sufficient stocks of anti-
ship munitions; uncrewed, runway independent systems; and long-range fires. In addition, the
United States needs assured access, basing, and overflight to use these capabilities in a conflict
and the ability to project these forces forward and sustain them. The Commission is encouraged
by recent agreements with regional allies and partners to expand U.S. access. But the Commis-
sion remains concerned by continued underinvestment in new and updated facilities in the First
and Second Island Chains, as well as the lack of new forces postured west of the International
Date Line. Finally, the United States needs to work diplomatically and militarily to continue

enhancing the capabilities of its network of allies and partners across the region to resist aggres-
sion through a mixture of high-end capabilities (such as nuclear-powered attack submarines in
Australia’s case) and asymmetric means (such as mines, uncrewed surface and underwater ves-
sels, and air defense in Taiwan’s case).
Europe
In Europe, the United States will likely continue to need to maintain its current level of forward
posture and should consider shifting some of its rotational presence to permanently based forc-
es.31 While European spending is on the upswing, Europe’s rearmament is proving slower than
it should be, especially in wealthier countries that are farther from Russia’s borders.32 Conse-
quently, the United States should boost its forward presence in Eastern Europe—built around
an armored corps and complete with headquarters, fires, air defenses and armored, sustainment,
and aviation units—to deter Russian aggression against NATO’s eastern flank.33 Ultimately,
the goal is for Europe to take on a larger role in providing for its defense, with assured and criti-
cal support of the United States. In light of the potential for simultaneous conflicts, capability
targets apportioned to European allies through the NATO Defense Planning Process should be
intentionally selected to reduce overreliance on the United States for key capabilities enablers.
New European defense investments should be focused on delivering on those capability targets.
Ukraine in its fight against Russia. In practice, this means ensuring an uninterrupted flow of
intelligence and weaponry that has proven integral to Ukraine’s defense thus far—particularly
ATACMS, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), Abrams tanks, Bradley
fighting vehicles, air defenses, and F-16s—as well as the associated munitions and sustainment
capabilities. We believe that the United States should also maintain a larger presence on the
ground in Ukraine to learn lessons from that war and proactively field and test new technologies
on the modern battlefield that can be integrated into the Joint Force.
The Middle East
The United States has enduring interests in the Middle East that will require a stabilizing pres-
ence to deter conflict.34 Notably, this presence need not rely heavily on high-end platforms that
are better suited for other theaters, nor should it rely on the military presence of the past two
decades. The Commission is impressed with the Navy’s Task Force 59 as a good example of
leveraging relatively low-cost innovative concepts to solve the region’s security challenges.

extremist organizations (VEOs)” (DoD, 2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States, p. 2).
State and other jihadist terrorist organizations, the United States will need to maintain a robust
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance apparatus; air defenses (to protect its bases); and
air and special operations forces to action the targets. And it will need to maintain a global pos-
ture and force readiness that enables the Joint Force to surge conventional forces into theater on
relatively short time frames, as appropriate.
Africa and Latin America
Although both Africa and Latin America get relatively little focus in the NDS, they both are
important theaters of great power competition. Both China and Russia are making inroads in
these regions, often to the detriment of the United States and its allies. Countries in both regions
are also wrestling with a host of other security challenges—from internal instability, to climate
change, to terrorism—that affect U.S. security interests.
such as security force assistance brigades, civil affairs, special operations forces, and airlift—can
have an outsize impact. Importantly, given that competition in these regions is largely playing
in the diplomatic, informational, and economic arenas, the United States needs to ensure that
DoD is supporting other parts of the U.S. government that play lead roles in furthering U.S.
national security interests but that are often underresourced to do so effectively. The United
States requires a civilian presence, with DoD support, to present alternatives to Chinese and
Russian entreaties, development, harvesting of natural resources, and facilities and capabilities
for projecting power, such as commercial seaports, bases, and infrastructure for space operations.
Space and Cyberspace
Space and cyberspace are critical domains, and each has its unique challenges and risks. Demands
for space and cyberspace assets are, perhaps, harder to quantify than posture in the physical
domains, but they nonetheless underpin the Joint Force’s operational and information advan-
tage and ability to function. Both are active domains now, as evidenced by repeated cyberattacks
from all U.S. peer adversaries and by Russian attempts to jam U.S. satellites in Ukraine. We
fully believe that space and cyberspace would be active domains in any future full-fledged war,
and that the United States should invest in building capability and capacity to empower military
operations and resilience.
tive domains, the Commission emphasizes the need for the United States to increase the capacity
and capability in both to maintain U.S. advantage (or parity) and to be prepared for the need to
surge in these areas in the event of a likely conflict. The Commission also emphasizes the need
to better integrate both space and cyberspace capabilities into conventional war planning and
with U.S. Strategic Command, so that these domains are leveraged to the fullest extent possible.
Commission on the National Defense Strategy
Transportation
The last time the U.S. military conducted a major strategic deployment was more than 20 years
ago at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, which was largely uncontested and not time
constrained. The next strategic deployment is likely to be over a major crisis, potentially on
short notice and with the very real possibility of cyber disruption and kinetic interdiction. The
leadership at TRANSCOM is focused on this challenge and has improved coordination and
communication with the private sector owners and operators of the critical infrastructure and
commercial transportation providers on which TRANSCOM relies. The command needs to be
able to periodically exercise the mobilization and deployment of forces as part of campaigning
requirements. The Secretary of Defense should be delegated partial mobilization authority spe-
cifically to exercise this authority with a funding mechanism to improve mobilization capabili-
ties, increase readiness, and provide much-needed deterrence.
ness needed to operate in a combat environment. Sealift ships, mobility aircraft, and ground
support at nodes must be securely and reliably connected to see and understand the threats and
respond to meet dynamic mission requirements at scale. Logistics should be integrated with all
joint functions and be viewed as a true joint enabler. The Commission recommends that mobil-
ity fleets be resourced to ensure sufficient credible capacity, with the connectivity, survivability,
and agility to successfully maneuver and sustain the Joint Force in future combat operations.
The Commission further recommends addressing the relative underinvestment in key assets,
such as aerial refueling, strategic airlift, sealift, and intratheater lift (air and sea), that are neces-
sary to deploy and support combat operations.
Special Operations
During the Global War on Terrorism, the special operations community was at the forefront of
the U.S. military response. The strategic environment has shifted, but special operations forces
remain an essential tool of military power, both for their contributions to the remaining threat
from violent extremists and because special operations forces have a vital role in great power
competition—particularly in building influence with allies and partners and countering gray-
zone threats.
and funding. However, we recommend that Army Special Forces in particular shift resources
from counterterrorism and direct action to unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, and
foreign internal defense.
Nuclear Modernization
In consideration of the October 2023 Strategic Posture Commission’s report, we largely
avoided another independent review of the U.S. strategic deterrent.35 However, we note that,
as China develops a full-fledged nuclear triad and Russia threatens to employ nuclear weapons
35
in Ukraine—not to mention continued advancements in the North Korean nuclear arsenal and
the threat of Iranian nuclear proliferation—the U.S. strategic deterrent remains critical. The
United States is in the midst of recapitalizing all three legs of the nuclear triad—with the B-21
bomber, Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile, and Columbia-class submarine. Especially
given the worsening threat environment, it is existential for U.S. national security that these
modernization programs continue at pace to preserve the strategic deterrent. Given the scale
of this generational investment in America’s strategic deterrent, the Commission supports fully
funding nuclear modernization but also ensuring that these efforts do not come at the expense
of modernizing and expanding the Navy and Air Force conventional forces.
Chapter 7
The Defense Industrial Base and
Defense Production
As multiple senior DoD officials have recognized, “Production is deterrence.”1 But today, the
United States has a DIB with too few people, too few companies, declining and unstable finan-
cial support, and insufficient production capacity to meet the needs of the Joint Force in both
peacetime and wartime.2 Failure to restore the former might of U.S. defense production capabil-
ity and capacity not only would render the objectives of the 2022 NDS unachievable but also
would gravely erode the credibility of U.S. deterrence, undermine U.S. support to allies and
partners in a crisis or conflict, and leave the Joint Force ill-prepared and ill-equipped to fight
and win a conflict.
of the U.S. industrial sector, the increased sophistication of modern weapon systems, and other
factors mean the United States no longer has the capability for a World War II–style industrial
mobilization “involving conversion of civilian industry to military use, mass production, a long
buildup of forces, [and] well-equipped, massive armies that overwhelm opponents.”3

government—particularly DoD—with defense-related materials, products, and services. It is composed of
commercial firms (from large, traditional defense companies to small tech startups) and government-owned
industrial facilities (such as maintenance depots, research centers, and university laboratories), among other
entities. It provides platforms (e.g., ships and aircraft), weapons, software, operational support, commercial
products, basic services, and more. As DoD, National Defense Industrial Strategy, p. 7, summarizes, “A robust
and resilient industrial base provides the enduring foundation for military advantage.” See Nicastro, The U.S.

The Defense Industrial Base and NDS Implementation
The Joint Force relies on the DIB to maintain and operate ready forces; field sufficient quanti-
ties of platforms, weapons, and other enablers for U.S., allied, and partner forces; and regenerate
forces during and after a conflict. However, the Commission finds that insufficient U.S. defense
production capacity presents major challenges for implementation of the NDS.
in a protracted conflict, especially with China and particularly in terms of munitions. Defense
experts have extensively documented that DoD “has long failed to invest adequately in stocks of
preferred munitions,” which remains true even after DoD’s efforts to boost munitions produc-
tion in response to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.4 As a result, unclassified public wargames
suggest that, in a conflict with China, the United States would largely exhaust its munitions
inventories in as few as three to four weeks, with some important munitions (e.g., anti-ship mis-
siles) lasting only a few days.5 Once expended, replacing these munitions would take years.6

the deteriorating condition of defense depots, contract maintenance performance issues, and
underproduction of spare parts, among many others. Longer and more frequent maintenance
delays and spiraling repair costs mean U.S. Navy ships are spending less time at sea.7 Likewise,
underinvestment in depot repair capacity and lack of spare parts contribute to unsatisfactory

trial base. As a result, the Navy’s ability to construct, maintain, and repair the maritime forces
it requires is fundamentally in doubt. For the past two decades, the Navy has been shrinking
as ship retirements have largely outpaced the procurement of new ships.9 However, recognizing
that China’s navy has more battle force ships and significantly larger production capacity, the
U.S. Navy has sought to reverse its decline and set a goal of fielding 381 battle force ships, up
from 287 today. As described before, the U.S. shipbuilding industry faces major obstacles to
producing this number of vessels, including destroyers and Virginia- and Columbia-class subma-
rines, until at least 2042 and only with significantly increased investment and expanded capacity
of the shipbuilding industrial base.10
One Chinese shipyard has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined.11 As former Marine
Corps Commandant David Berger warned in 2020,
Roles of Allies and Partners
DoD “anchors” the NDS on allies and partners and relies on “coordination with and contribution
of Allies and partners” to deter aggression when the United States is engaged in an all-domain
conflict elsewhere.13 However, allies and partners rely on U.S. defense production capacity to a
significant degree, so U.S. defense production will be required regardless of who is fighting. For
example, one analysis found that, aside from the United States, “no country in NATO . . . has
sufficient initial weapons stocks for warfighting or the industrial capacity to sustain largescale
operations . . . . At the height of the fighting in Donbas, Russia was using more ammunition in
two days than the entire British military has in stock.”14

Despite laudable efforts by DoD to ramp up production in support of Ukraine, Russia is on pace
to produce nearly three times more artillery munitions than the United States and Europe com-
bined.15 In some cases, DoD hesitated to provide certain weapons to Ukraine out of concern that
doing so “would undercut the readiness of U.S. forces for other possible conflicts.”16 Even with
sustained funding, some U.S. weapon inventories are unlikely to be restored within five years.17

the most significant strategic opportunities for the United States, fully consistent with the objec-
tives of the NDS. But the limits of the U.S. DIB have raised major concerns about AUKUS’s
feasibility, particularly as it relates to the sale of U.S. attack submarines to Australia.19 Moreover,
despite strong support for AUKUS at the highest levels of the presidential administration and
across Congress, the U.S. government has struggled to share the necessary information and tech-
nology with two of its closest allies.

Commission on the National Defense Strategy
Recommendations
DoD has taken steps some initial steps to strengthen the DIB, including the publication of the
National Defense Industrial Strategy and its expanded use of multiyear procurement authority
for preferred munitions when that authority has been supported by Congress. DoD has requested
additional legislative authority to raise limits on multiyear production and to expand the author-
ity to other programs, which the Commission supports.
The proposed SHIPYARD Act, introduced in 2021 on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, is an
example of the scope and scale required.
pronged approach. First, although Congress granted DoD multiyear authority for certain muni-
tions, it has been slow to provide and enable appropriations to implement this concept.24 Second,
Congress needs to significantly increase the level of investment domestically in munitions and in
the capacity to build them. Third, DoD needs to work with other countries to expand produc-
tion capacity for munitions across U.S. allies and partners to build added resiliency in the supply
chain. Fourth, while continuing to expand production of existing munitions, DoD needs to
invest in new munitions and weapons to keep pace with warfighter needs and expand the DIB.
Fifth, DoD needs to fund the recapitalization of armories and invest in advanced manufacturing
and further stockpiling of munitions. Finally, DoD needs to seek to increase interoperability of
parts and ensure that it can buy all munitions at sufficient scale to deliver the desired operational
effects.
of disincentives that smaller and nontraditional defense companies face when producing defense-
related hardware or software. Such disincentives include unreliable flow of money, significantly
more regulations than exist for other procurement, and more stringent requirements than exist
in commercial markets.25 DoD is encouraging direct acquisition from small and midsize busi-
nesses as one approach to this problem, but others are needed. The Commission recommends
that DoD consider providing continual funding for stockpiles of strategic parts, streamlining
clearances for personnel at sub-tier companies, focusing requirements for testing and perfor-
mance at larger “prime” contractors rather than suppliers, and encouraging interoperable parts
and software across more programs.26 While some defense activities require higher levels of per-
formance or reliability than commercial products (because of austere environments or risk to

production to commercialization justifies a whole-scale review and reduction (where possible) of
barriers to using commercial products and software for defense purposes.

to U.S. Code, Title 10, Section 3601—to initiate urgent or emerging operational development activities for a
period of up to one year. Use of these authorities is limited to the purpose of leveraging an emergent techno-
logical advancement of value to the national defense to address a military service–specific need or to provide
a rapid response to an emerging threat identified by a military service (Public Law 118-31, National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024).
Chapter 8
Personnel and Readiness
The 2022 NDS notes that the “extraordinary people” of DoD and the all-volunteer force are
America’s “most valuable resource.”1 The Commission emphatically agrees but believes more
must be done to maximize this resource. DoD needs to recruit, retain, and mobilize military
personnel and hire and equip a civilian workforce of the size, skill, and creativity required to
address the sizable challenges facing the nation. The Commission also notes that the people in
DoD are joined in achieving national security goals by skilled professionals serving in other U.S.
departments and agencies, in Congress, in the industrial sector, and at think tanks, as well as
other experts, all of whom depend on an educated, motivated, and service-oriented public.
Military Recruitment and Retention
The U.S. military is facing significant recruiting challenges that threaten the viability of the all-
volunteer force. Diminished force size threatens readiness to meet existing needs and fulfill the
missions dictated by the NDS, let alone to achieve the additional requirements to implement the
all elements of national power approach and force construct recommended by the Commission.
duty recruiting goals.2 Halfway through FY 2024, the Army and Air Force indicated that their
recruitment levels were substantially improved from the previous year, while the Navy expected
to remain short.3 Reduced propensity and eligibility to serve have contributed to these shortfalls.

which has been exacerbated by public narratives related to the dangers of military service, dif-
ficulties in transitioning from military to civilian life, the unclear value proposition of military
service on future educational and career prospects, and a lack of familiarity with military service
for much of the population.5 Negative experiences of recently separated and serving military
personnel—such as the publicized challenges in securing safe housing and food scarcity; racial,
gender, and sexual orientation discrimination and harassment; mental health challenges, such
as posttraumatic stress disorder; and the impact of moves on spouse employment and child
education—further contribute to both the recruitment of new military personnel and the reten-
tion of service members.6 These experiences have further narrowed potential recruitment pools
and have increased the reliance on financial incentives for enlistment and retention.
recruiting crisis shows that the United States can no longer continue to target the same com-
munities with the same methods it has used for decades. The U.S. military can no longer rely
on recruitment centers in strip malls or billboards to communicate the value of service and cap-

gibility requirements for military service.11 The Commission notes that the services have begun
their own post–high school training courses to help interested candidates achieve the academic
or physical requirements to serve and boast thousands of successful recruitments due to these
programs. The Commission supports changes to military standards to enable those who wish to
serve to do so. The need to waive requirements to enable eligibility suggests that military stan-
dards need modification. This may require changes to the medical conditions that are allowable
for enlistment and reenlistment or placing personnel in military career fields that are appropri-
ate for their conditions in order to allow them to serve.12 That is not to suggest that standards
should drop; rather, they should adapt to enable individuals with a propensity to serve to do so,
and DoD should review whether existing standards have kept up with societal norms.
change. American society must understand the value of service—both military and civilian—
and effective narratives should highlight how service to the nation contributes to society. The
fact that military retention rates remain high demonstrates that people involved in the services
find value in their work; DoD should find more ways to showcase their experience. DoD must
better inform Americans, with the backing of elected officials and business and civic leaders,
about the unique experiences that military and government service can provide and how such
service will serve Americans in their careers and lives. Leveraging social media to promote this
narrative will ensure broader reach and engage new communities. We emphasized these themes
in Chapter 4 in relation to an all elements of national power approach to defense and national
security.
tain retention rates. The Commission urges the services to better link enlistment and service to
future employment and develop programs so that military service begins and ends with a job
already in hand. Where possible, job offers should be in critical industries and the sectors most
needed to ensure U.S. strength, such as the DIB.

sonnel can gain critical skills outside the military through education or entering the civilian
workforce and bring them back to the military, may prove more beneficial to retention than
an “up-or-out” policy or could provide a viable second pathway. We believe this policy will

ment or commissioning at a young age, followed by many years of continued service with fre-
quent rotation requirements. Especially given the increase in marriage and family rates among
military personnel, this model places considerable stress on military families. The services have
begun to implement policy changes to reduce deployments, assist with spousal employment,
and provide “employ-in-place” opportunities for those with specialized skills.15 We recommend
broader implementation of these policies to help retain talent in the services.
Civilian Hiring and Retention
Hiring and retention are also a challenge for the civilian workforce, which must be strengthened
to create the comprehensive solutions to the problems at hand. DoD is routinely edged out of
critical technical skills and language and area expertise by the private sector, which offers more-
competitive salaries and incentives, an easier hiring process, promotion potential, and flexible
working hours and locations. Part of the problem, as a Defense Business Board study found, is
that DoD has not marketed itself as an attractive civilian employer, making it difficult to com-
pete against the private sector.16
highlight the importance of the public service mission, and create new personnel policies that
enable flexibility, employee growth and promotion, and civilian talent management. DoD
should seek to create a noncontinuous option for service, whereby personnel can and are encour-
aged to cycle out of government service, gain critical skills in the private sector, and come back
to public service. Existing policies, including benefits and security clearance, disincentivize such
movement. Specialized skills—particularly in advanced technologies, such as AI—should be
retained by such incentives as competitive pay and flexible work environments, as they are for
military and certain other types of civilian government work.

tional programs to defense needs.17 Doing so would develop a new generation of Americans with
the technical and language skills needed to fight future wars, develop and build defense technol-
ogy, and understand U.S. adversaries. We vehemently believe that the United States must make
investments today to build the future civil servants that the United States needs.
edge the progress made in strengthening DoD’s civilian workforce as hiring freezes have been
lifted, new direct hiring authorities have been established, and programs created by Congress
(such as the John S. McCain Strategic Defense Fellowship) have yielded a new cadre of young
civil servants.18 However, there is more to be done to create hiring pathways into DoD for those
who wish to serve, provide opportunities for detailees and participants in the Intergovernmental
Personnel Act mobility program to be hired by DoD, and create more flexibility to move jobs
within DoD and the military services. The Commission encourages DoD to make greater use
of existing hiring authorities, especially Direct Hire Authorities and other hiring flexibilities
provided by Congress.19 Even with these authorities, we find that new hiring authorities are
likely needed to bring in civilian personnel with the advanced technical and analytic skills sorely
needed to meet the demands of future conflict.
Service and Mobilization
The requirements of peer or near-peer conflict, especially given the likelihood of simultaneous
conflicts and protracted fighting discussed earlier, raise serious questions about whether the size
of the force is sufficient and could be sustained.20 Although such a consideration potentially is
politically volatile, DoD should, in conjunction with other elements of the executive branch,
consider what mandatory mobilization means and would entail. Doing so would strengthen U.S.
preparedness for future conflict and, in the process, bolster deterrence. The Commission agrees
in this regard with the recommendations of the National Commission on Military, National,
and Public Service and a June 2024 Center for a New American Security report, including that
DoD should name an executive agent for mobilization and that DoD should lead exercises in
peacetime to practice and identify shortcomings in the Selective Service System.21
that requirements for mandatory service include not only military service but defense industrial
work, skilled trade programs, health care, protection and resilience of critical infrastructure, and

other relevant work. The integration of the DIB into force planning means that a potential con-
flict with a major adversary would involve not only the military but also the private sector work-
force. Just as World War II led to a major mobilization of key industries, so too would a future
conflict.22 We recommend increased planning now by DoD, the Department of Commerce, and
others about what commercial mobilization would entail, whether the authorities in the Defense
Production Act and elsewhere are sufficient, and the resources associated with such an effort.
about the lack of military, public, and national service by the U.S. population and the impor-
tance of volunteering, shared sacrifice, and supporting the national good. The U.S. public are
largely unaware of the dangers facing the nation and do not understand the devastating impact a
potential conflict could have on daily life. This not only affects efforts to build preparedness in
peacetime but could also affect national mobilization in the event of major conflict. The Com-
mission believes the nation needs a renewed sense of engagement and patriotism, and we support
calls for increased public and civic service. It is outside the Commission’s charter to conduct a
detailed review, but we commend the National Commission on Military, National, and Public
Service for its report on the topic.23
Readiness Challenges
The NDS tasks the Joint Force to be ready for strategic competition, with an emphasis on China
and Russia, while maintaining the ability to respond to small-scale and short global crises rapidly
and credibly.24 As a global power, the United States must be able to deter the threats it faces in
multiple theaters in a tailored, timely fashion while preparing the military for potential future
conflict against advanced adversaries.

tonight.” We believe the readiness levels of the Joint Force are insufficient to meet the expanded
force-sizing objectives that we laid out in Chapter 6.
ion around the globe. It is guided by three essential questions: Ready for what? Ready for when?
And what needs to be ready?25 The answers to these questions dictate trade-offs among the mis-
sions and operations, timelines, and force employment. The biggest trade-offs in terms of readi-

ness are between what is required to “fight tonight” and the requirements to prepare to be able to
“fight tomorrow.” Near-term requirements often emphasize the availability of forces to deploy to
conduct peacetime operations and crisis response, whereas longer-term requirements emphasize
training and equipping forces to build proficiency on new capabilities and warfighting missions
in preparation for future conflict.
expending readiness for today’s challenges and preserving readiness for tomorrow to become
increasingly fraught. DoD has made great strides in rebuilding readiness that had eroded due
to unanticipated force demands, but these improvements may be ephemeral. We believe there is
an underappreciated and burgeoning readiness challenge that DoD and Congress must urgently
address.
Middle East. U.S. forces are shoring up deterrence on NATO’s Eastern Flank by training and
equipping Ukrainian soldiers in their fight against Russia.26 In the Middle East, the United
States has increased its military presence and security assistance to Israel since the October 7,
2023, attack.27 It has also strengthened U.S. presence in the Red Sea, where U.S. and ally and
partner forces have routinely come under attack from Houthi drones and missiles.
high demand for “stressed” force elements with multiple requirements across theaters, such as
air defense and aerial refueling. The extraordinary level of munitions consumption and demand
by allies and partners in Europe and, more recently, preferred munitions expenditures in the
CENTCOM area of responsibility—a region of risk acceptance in the NDS—also provide cause
for concern because these stockpiles are already inadequate for a high-end conflict. The result of
these crisis response missions has been unplanned and extended deployments, additional forces

expenditure of readiness to exercise and demonstrate capability for operations aligned to defense
priorities, as it can interrupt force generation cycles.30 The constant demand for presence opera-

cially when paired with the training requirements to prepare for great power competition and
conflict. The Army, in particular, has felt the strain of the high operational tempo for campaign-

ing on its readiness.31 The U.S. Navy is also suffering from readiness issues stemming from its
high operational tempo, aging ships, shipyard backlogs, and crew fatigue.32 Continued mishaps
at sea and in military aviation pose risks to troop safety and are symptomatic of a decline in read-
iness, reflecting both a lack of experience and the increased complexity of the future warfighting

warfighting with peer or near-peer competitors. This is an evolutionary process that requires
force modernization and breaking the path dependency of existing exercises, training, and pro-
fessional military education to align them to the future challenges and missions in a highly con-
tested environment, which require greater technical skills and proficiencies.34 But there is still a
yawning gap between readiness for steady state campaigning activities and warfighting.
ready for tomorrow. The Commission believes that the U.S. military must be ready to respond to
today’s crises while being prepared to fight alongside U.S. allies and partners to deter and, if nec-
essary, win wars in the future. DoD and Congress must do more to improve the readiness of the
Joint Force to meet this standard. We note that, to meet the budget caps of the Fiscal Respon-
sibility Act of 2023, DoD was forced in its FY 2025 budget submission to choose between the
fight tonight and preparation for future war in its future budget. The request understandably
emphasizes near-term priority. As we recommend elsewhere, Congress should exercise its pre-
rogative to amend the law to fund both near-term readiness and necessary longer-term prepara-
tion for future conflict.
Readiness Reform
The Commission applauds DoD’s effort to understand readiness trade-offs over time and the
emphasis on senior leader decisionmaking support. DoD has advanced a new framework of
strategic readiness, which broadens the concept of readiness beyond the near-term availability of
forces to holistically weigh the factors that influence the military’s ability to fight across time,
threats, and geography. These factors include sustainment, modernization, allies and partners,
business systems and organizational effectiveness, human capital, global posture, force struc-

ture, resilience, operational readiness, and mobilization.35 DoD’s understanding of the trade-offs
among these metrics has been bolstered by descriptive and predictive analytic tools, such as the
Readiness Decision Impact Model (RDIM).36 The intent is to help senior leaders make choices
that balance competing priorities and requirements, understand trade-offs between resourcing a
request today and future readiness, and make decisions that align to the NDS priorities.
assessment of Joint Force readiness. However, we find that the proliferation of readiness metrics
obscures the critical questions of whether forces are available and ready to deploy and whether
they are ready for the demands of future warfare. For example, operational readiness—whether
forces are ready and available to “fight tonight”—is a component of strategic readiness. This
means the Joint Force can be operationally but not strategically ready. We believe these termi-
nologies make it difficult for senior leaders and lawmakers to understand force readiness levels.
Moreover, there is variability in measuring operational readiness, as each service has specific
approaches to capturing readiness metrics that reflect its own doctrine and organization.37 We
urge DoD to be more transparent in its terminology, framework, and readiness metrics. Greater
transparency is needed in readiness assessments and reporting, including in data and reporting
provided to Congress and the public.38

prioritization laid out in the NDS and has reduced additional demands on finite resources.

poor military performance in Ukraine in 2022 demonstrated that it lacked the readiness levels
required for a successful invasion.42 All signs indicate that Moscow has learned its lesson as it
takes steps to reconstitute its forces and readiness to regain a battlefield advantage. China’s Presi-
dent Xi has emphasized the need to build the PLA’s combat readiness, and DoD assesses that the
PLA has made progress in improving readiness.43 Readiness is a critical component of the United
States’ ability to deter threats and, if needed, fight and defeat adversaries.

The United States faces the most challenging and most dangerous international security envi-

end of the Cold War. During that period, including the Korean War and Vietnam War, DoD

strategic instability and escalation, and need for U.S. global presence. The comparison does not
reflect many significant differences between that period and today. Among these differences are
advances in technology that fundamentally change the character of warfare and the shift from
traditional DoD-led R&D and procurement to private sector–driven investment and innovation
and commercial production of hardware and software. When incorporated through improved
operational concepts, these advances have enormous national security potential that place the

rity, and a unity of effort across government (including Congress) behind shared security mis-
sions that are missing today. Defense spending in the Cold War relied on top marginal income
tax rates above 70 percent and corporate tax rates above 50 percent.1 Using the Cold War as
a benchmark for spending should be accompanied by acknowledging the other fundamental
changes that could supplement America’s efforts to deter threats and prepare for the future.

Recommendations to Spend More Effectively
Building all the elements of national power necessary to preserve U.S. influence, deter conflict,
and defeat adversaries (if needed), the U.S. government must spend funds more efficiently and
more effectively and must increase spending levels.5

than a regular full-year budget. From FY 2010 to FY 2024, defense continuing resolutions aver-
aged 120 days each year, and DoD spent close to 1,800 total days operating under temporary
funding—the equivalent of nearly five full years (Figure 9.3).

has developed practices to mitigate some consequences of temporary funding.7 Continuing reso-
lutions force DoD to spend late-delivered funds in less time, undermining desired execution
rates and aggravating year-end spending surges.8 Continuing resolutions also typically prohibit
new program starts and increased production rates, halting innovation and optimization.9 Over-
all, the evolution of continuing resolutions from emergency stopgap to regular business has dis-
rupted DoD operations.
Given recent history, however, we also concur with the PPBE Commission’s recommendation
that continuing resolutions should permit both new program starts and increased production
rates under certain well-defined criteria.10 We also applaud Congress for including in the FY 2024
National Defense Authorization Act a provision to allow military services to begin spending
funds on new programs under emerging threats or the identification of new technologies.11
Spend Smarter
DoD and Congress should review all major systems against likely future needs, prioritizing
agility, interoperability, and survivability. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint
Staff should be more empowered to cancel programs, determine needs for the future, and invest
accordingly. DoD should invest more in cyber, space, and software, which have enabled war-
fighting for decades but are now central to conflict and are global.

savings, on average, through performance improvement initiatives.12 Congress often approves

fewer cost savings than what DoD proposes, particularly by blocking proposed weapon system
divestments.13 There are often legitimate disagreements over what constitutes “legacy systems”
and when to end programs, but there are clearly institutional incentives within the services,
DoD, and Congress to keep existing programs.14 The Commission recommends addressing
those incentives. For DoD, this might mean ensuring that money saved from ending a pro-
gram will remain with the service for higher-priority needs. For Congress, divestments might
be more palatable if DoD and industry worked to keep jobs in a district, potentially through

of fewer, more advanced, and more complicated systems and greater use of commercially avail-
able technology. We expect that, in addition to operational benefits, such an approach will reduce
costs in DoD R&D, procurement, and operations and maintenance accounts. The Commis-
sion also heard repeatedly that services can upgrade capability through regular software updates
rather than by building new platforms. In many instances, better integration between the U.S.
and allies’ industrial bases can yield cost savings and improved readiness through co production,
aligning procurement to the industrial strengths of allies, and making better use of allies’ infra-
structure for repair and maintenance. DoD has increasingly requested the authority to spend
funds more efficiently and more reliably through multiyear procurements and block buy con-
tracting, with mixed approval from Congress. These authorities provide the dual benefit of
reducing overall costs and providing more-reliable funding mechanisms for industry.
changes and adjust priorities to spend national security funds more effectively and more effi-
ciently. These reform efforts should include rewriting regulations to speed defense procurement
(and address cultural impediments and risk aversion) and shifting the R&D paradigm to better
adopt technological innovation from outside DoD for warfighting purposes. The U.S. govern-
ment also should enable and facilitate information-sharing and export controls to better work
with allies.
Recommendations for Additional Resources
Americans rightfully demand that DoD and Congress work relentlessly to maximize the mili-
tary and other forms of national security power generated by their taxpayer dollars, and advo-
cates for additional defense spending have an obligation to ensure that existing funds are being
spent wisely. Decades of review, however, suggest that no feasible combination of institutional

expand and harden facilities in Asia; secure access to critical minerals; and invest in a digital and
industrial workforce.
that serve as the basis for the FY 2025 budget request. For FY 2025, real growth in defense and
nondefense national security spending is needed and, at a bare minimum, should fall within
the range recommended by the 2018 NDS Commission. While the reforms recommended
above are made and investments in capacity from the supplemental appropriation are under-
way, increased spending should be allocated to prioritize near-term readiness demands to restore
and re inforce deterrence. Policymakers should not spread increased spending around the entire
defense bureaucracy, as this will not produce the desired effect of a more capable force to deter
and, if needed, succeed in war.
